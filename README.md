Ryca Zhang, Rocket Patrol Mods, 6/29/2021. It takes me 6 hours.
  Add your own (copyright-free) background music to the Play scene (5)
  Create a new scrolling tile sprite for the background (5)
  Create a new title screen (e.g., new artwork, typography, layout) (10)
  Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (20)
  Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic (to something other than sci-fi) (60)
    (Theme: In this game, you are a farmer. One day you see there are many annoying birds flying around your house. Hold up your gun and shoot them! )
    (I created eagles, bullets, crows, background and new explosion animation using Aseprite.)
